# Cardano Private-Testnet / Devnet Setup

![Ansible Lint](https://github.com/woofpool/cardano-private-testnet-setup/actions/workflows/ci.test.yml/badge.svg)

---

This project provides instructions and shell scripts to bootstrap a private Cardano testnet and connect a `cardano-db-sync` process to it.
If you don't want to bother with setting up `cardano-db-sync`, you can easily skip over the sections of this project that are not relevant.

---
**Note about cardano-db-sync:**

There were some recent changes made to the `cardano-db-sync` sources that cause an issue when trying to attach the
db-sync process to the private testnet.  The author has logged an issue for this: [issue](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/issues/1046).
Please skip any guide instructions having to do with setting up/running `cardano-db-sync` until the issue is resolved.
---

The scripts used by this project to create the private Cardano testnet are taken from the IOHK `cardano-node` project and have been modified as needed.
You may find the original script files in the IOHK git repository: [cardano-node scripts](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/tree/master/scripts/byron-to-alonzo).
In particular, running `cardano-db-sync` to sync to the private testnet required a few changes to the original scripts provided by IOHK.

Hopefully, this documentation provides a lot of value for others. I welcome your feedback both good and bad!

### Minimum system requirements
- **Operating System** : documentation is based on Ubuntu (Debian) linux, but can be adapted to other flavors of linux, as well as Darwin MacOS
    - The IOG scripts used to start node processes should be compatible with any linux variant and Darwin MacOS
- **Processor** : In the [mkfiles script](scripts/mkfiles.sh), each `cardano-node` is configured to run 4 CPU cores in parallel.
                  This configuration may be changed as necessary to fit your system constraints.
                  Search for `cardano-node run` in `mkfiles.sh` to modify.
- **RAM** : Each node is using about 1/3 GB of RAM, which gives 1 GB of RAM for 3 nodes total.
- **Disk space** : The amount of disk space used to run the network will grow the longer you are running.
               For the author, after running for a full day, each node used 1.8 GB of disk space, which gives 5.4 GB for 3 nodes total.
               Depending on your system capacity, one could kill the node processes, delete the persisted state, and initialize a fresh network
               as necessary.
- **Recommended** : Overall, a 4 core CPU with 2+ GB of available RAM and 10 GB of disk space is sufficient
                    and provides some excess capacity.
                    
  

### Why is this useful?
- A private Cardano testnet provides a controlled environment to execute transactions
- With `cardano-db-sync` connected to your private testnet, you can use SQL queries to view blockchain activity data.
- You can use this controlled environment for local Cardano development.
- Lastly, it is a great learning experience to set up your own private testnet and learn about the data stored on the blockchain.

### Key Details
- The private testnet consists of three block-producing node processes.
- The `cardano-db-sync` process syncs blockchain data to a highly normalized database schema. This enables blockchain data to be queried with SQL.
- The example transactions include setting up keys and wallet address for new user, transfering ADA from one user wallet address to another
  and executing a Plutus script for a vesting contract.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Install Cardano executables**

    * Install the following executables: `cardano-node`, `cardano-cli`, and optionally `cardano-db-sync`
    * Please refer to the [Install executables guide](1-INSTALL_EXECUTABLES.md) for instructions.
    
2. **Optional: Install PostgreSQL packages and create Postgres user** 
    
    * The `cardano-db-sync` process uses a connection to a PostgreSQL database.
    * Please refer to the [Install posgreSQL](2-INSTALL_POSTGRESQL.md) for instructions to set up.

3. **Run scripts to set up & run private Cardano network and optionally connect DB Sync process**

    * Run scripts to bootstrap the Cardano private network and attach the `cardano-db-sync` process to it to sync blockchain data to SQL database.
    * Please refer to the [Run network scripts guide](3-RUN_NETWORK_SCRIPTS.md) for instructions. 

4. **Optional: Attach DB Sync process the network**

    * Attach the `cardano-db-sync` process to the network, which syncs blockchain data to a `PostgreSQL` database.
    * Please refer to the [Attach db-sync guide](4-ATTACH_DB_SYNC.md) for instructions.

5. **Run simple transaction and optionally query the db-sync database to see results**

    * Set up a new walllet for user2 and make a payment from user1 to user2. Query the database to confirm the transaction.
    * Please refer to the [Run transaction guide](5-RUN_TRANSACTION.md) for instructions.

6. **Run Plutus script transactions**

    * Build the project code for a simple vesting script, which sets User2 as the beneficiary with a vesting deadline
    * Set up transaction to give ADA from User1 to the script address and a transaction to grab ADA from the script by User2    
    * Please refer to the [Run Plutus Script transactions guide](6-RUN_PLUTUS_SCRIPT_TXS.md) for instructions.
